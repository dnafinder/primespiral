Play into the world of prime numbers! <br/>
Primespiral is a function to explore the distribution of prime numbers 
arranged into a spiral pattern. 
The well-known Ulam spiral and the variant developed by Robert Sacks, 
the Sacks spiral, show interesting geometric patterns in the positions of primes.

Syntax: primesout=primespiral(t)

    Inputs:
          t - is an integer number. The spiral will be plotted between 0 and t
              If t is omitted, it will be set to 3571 (between 0 and 3571
              there are 500 prime numbers).
    Outputs:
          primesout - the primes of the choosed family, between 0 and t.

The function will ask if you want to use the Ulam, Sacks, Vogel or Archimede spiral.
Then it will ask if you want to highlight a particular prime family.

    Outputs: 
          The primes of the family you choosed between 0 and t
